\section{Preliminaries Math}
In this chapter, it introduces some of the most fundamental math concepts. To better understand them, we will provide some metaphors.
\subsection{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Countable sets: A countable set compromises discrete elements. You can think of it like there is a hole or distance among the elements, no matter how close they are. 
    \item Uncountable sets: A uncountable set compromises continues elements. In mathematical language, no matter how small a distance is given, I can always find elements that fit in.
\end{itemize}
Countable sets and uncountable sets are important because you will find that they share a similar idea with calculus and calculus-based probability. 


\subsection{Difference between functions and equations}
Functions and equations are both widely used in our life but they are different. A function is a \textbf{relation} that associate the input to the output. A equation is a \textbf{statement} that two expressions are equal.An function can often be written as equation, but not every equation is a function. 

\subsection{Nonlinear Functions: Exponents, Logarithms, and Radicals}
In this part, you should take extra attentions to the rules of nonlinear functions because they are different than what you have learner before. \newline For exponents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiplication: \(x^m \times x^n = x^{m+n} \) 
    \item Division: \(x^m \div x^n = x^{m-n} \)
\end{itemize}
For logarithms:
Logarithms can be thought as the inverse of exponents. The logarithm of \(x^m\) is \(m\log(x)\).
\newline For radicals:
Roots are those are those numbers represented by the radical symbol.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x^m \sqrt{x^n} = x^{m/n} \)
    \item \(x^m \sqrt{x^n} = x^{m/n} \)
\end{itemize}

\section{Calculus: Differentiation, integration, and optimization}
Upon learning the new concepts of calculus, I found that some visualization would be very helpful. So here are some websites or YouTubers that I think will help you learn the concepts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/index.html}{Quick calculus concepts }
    \item Deeper and longer calc videos explained \href{https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus}{3blue1brown}
\end{itemize}
with that been said, let's continue to declare the concepts.

\subsection{Derivative}
In a word, derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of a function. In life, we may wanna know how far you can make by walking in 15 minutes, and that's the derivation of distance with respect to time. But time is just one example, we can also ask for the derivation with respect to space, population or anything. And that's the essence of the derivation.

\subsection{Integral}
If the derivative is about the instantaneous rate of change then anti-derivative or the integral is about the sum. The definite integral is a value whereas the indefinite integral is the function. And that's the fundamental truth behind the calculus: change and sum.
